## Quick Start

The following code defines a function `perform-calculation` that uses a time
limiter named `:some-name` and stored in the global registry. If the time
limiter does not already exist, one is created.

```clojure
(ns myproject.some-client
  (:require [resilience4clj.time-limiter :refer [with-time-limiter]])

(defn perform-calculation []
  (with-time-limiter :some-name
    ;; some expensive calculations
  ))
```

Refer to the [configuration guide](/doc/01_configuration.md) for more
information on how to configure the global registry as well as individual
time limiters.

Refer to the [usage guide](/doc/02_usage.md) for more information on how to
use time limiters.
